## Usage

### Default Login

- **Username**: admin
- **Password**: admin123

### Dashboard Management

1. Log in with the default credentials
2. Use the "Add New Section" button to create sections

4. Edit or delete existing cards and sections as needed

### Card Configuration

When adding a card, you can configure:

- **Title**: Name of the service

- **URL**: Link to the service
- **Icon**: Either an image URL or a Bootstrap icon
- **Button Icon**: Icon displayed on the action button
- **Order**: Position within its section

## Security

- The application uses secure session management
- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt
- Authentication is required for all routes
- Content Security Policy is implemented to prevent XSS attacks
- All API endpoints are protected against unauthorized access

## Docker Deployment

You can run this application in a Docker container for easier deployment and isolation.

### Using Docker Compose

1. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file in the project root:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  dashboard:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3002:3002"
    environment:
      - PORT=3002
      - NODE_ENV=production
      - ENVIRONMENT=PROD
      - DB_HOST=db
      - DB_PORT=3306
      - DB_NAME=dashboard_db
      - DB_USER=dashuser
      - DB_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
      - SESSION_SECRET=your_secure_session_secret
    depends_on:
      - db
    restart: unless-stopped
    
  db:
    image: mysql:8.0
    command: --default-authentication-plugin=mysql_native_password
    environment:
      - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root_password
      - MYSQL_DATABASE=dashboard_db
      - MYSQL_USER=dashuser
      - MYSQL_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
    volumes:
      - db_data:/var/lib/mysql
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  db_data:
```

2. Create a `Dockerfile` in the project root:

```dockerfile
FROM node:16-alpine

WORKDIR /app

COPY package*.json ./

RUN npm install --production

COPY . .

EXPOSE 3002

CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

3. Build and start the containers:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

4. Access the application at http://localhost:3002 (or your configured port)

### Using Docker without Compose

1. Create the `Dockerfile` as shown above

2. Build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t server-dashboard .
```

3. Run the container:

```bash
docker run -p 3002:3002 \
  -e PORT=3002 \
  -e NODE_ENV=production \
  -e ENVIRONMENT=PROD \
  -e DB_HOST=your_db_host \
  -e DB_PORT=3306 \
  -e DB_NAME=dashboard_db \
  -e DB_USER=your_db_user \
  -e DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password \
  -e SESSION_SECRET=your_session_secret \
  --name server-dashboard \
  -d server-dashboard
```

## Pterodactyl Deployment

You can deploy this application on a Pterodactyl panel using a NodeJS server egg.

### Setup Instructions

1. In your Pterodactyl panel, create a new server using a NodeJS egg

2. Server requirements:
   - NodeJS 14+ 
   - Minimum 512MB RAM
   - 1GB disk space

3. Upload your application files to the server:
   - Either using the file manager in the panel
   - Or via SFTP
   - Or by connecting your GitHub repository

4. Configure the following startup variables in the panel's Startup tab:
   - Make sure the startup command is set to `npm start`

5. Configure environment variables:
   - Add all required environment variables from the `.env` file in the Startup tab's Environment Variables section
   - Important: Make sure to set `DB_HOST` to point to your MySQL server's address

6. Start the server from the Pterodactyl panel

### Port Forwarding

The application uses the port specified in your `.env` file (default: 3002). Make sure:

1. This port is allocated in your Pterodactyl server configuration
2. The port is forwarded through your router if you're hosting at home
3. Any firewalls are configured to allow traffic on this port

**Note:** If you change the port in your `.env` file, you must make sure this new port:
- Is allocated in Pterodactyl
- Is not already in use by another application
- Is properly forwarded through any firewalls or routers

Using a reverse proxy like Nginx is recommended for exposing the application securely with SSL.
